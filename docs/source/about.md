# About

## What is NEMGLO?
NEMGLO, or the NEM Green-energy Load Optimisation tool is a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) which allows users to solve counterfactual operating strategies for a hypothetical load that would participate in the NEM energy market. Case studies can be constructed using this tool with a techno-economic-environmental consideration of a load in a historical period by collecting energy prices from a NEM region to consider in the optimisation. Further applying specifying technical parameters of a load, economic contracting strategies, and carbon emissions attribution, the model resolves a set of operating and financial outcomes for this hypothetical participant. Importantly, the participant is considered additional to the actual historic market outcomes (hence 'hypothetical' + 'counter-factual') and a price-taker of the market.

## Why does this tool exist?
This tool was developed as a Master's project at UNSW-CEEM with the aim to investigate flexible operation of hydrogen electrolysers in the NEM, in lieu of existing open-source tools that could provide operational, financial and environmental insights in a similar way. This tool acheives more sophisicated insights from modelling operating strategies formed through optimisation than that of simpler logic-based algorithms commonly used in cost-benefit analysis tools.
